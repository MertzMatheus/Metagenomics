# Metagenomics
This repository contains a complete shotgun metagenomics analysis pipeline, covering all steps from raw read processing to genome reconstruction (MAGs), taxonomic classification, and functional annotation. The pipeline is designed to be modular, reproducible, and easy to run, with dedicated Conda environments for each stage.
